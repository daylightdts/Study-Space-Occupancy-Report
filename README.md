![intro](https://github.com/daylightdts/Study-Space-Occupancy-Report/assets/134946052/da9c1788-ea4f-478d-a8b9-f31ecea5051d)

## Introduction

This project aims to uncover one (1) month user trends of a student learning space and ensure efficient resource allocation. Analyzing bookings, check-in and time data aims to uncover and extract valuable insights that will ultimately enhance the student experience and contribute to better facility utilization.



## Dataset Summary
![fields preview](https://github.com/daylightdts/Study-Space-Occupancy-Report/assets/134946052/57b27145-547a-4bb9-8c91-816b50a96aa6)

*Disclaimer:* This is a mock dataset generated online and does not represent any company, institution or country.
We hereby make some assumptions since the dataset isn't complete.


### Assumptions:

a) Each student is allowed 2 hours maximum at the space per day.

b) Checkings and checkouts are exactly on the hour.

c) The space is open from 8 am to 10 pm.



***Since there's no checkout time we need to validate the dataset.***

a) All check-ins at 20:00 must have 2 hours maximum time spent.

b) Checkings with missing or null values must have 0 hours as time spent.
